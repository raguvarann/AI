Projects
**1. Predictive Analytics: House Price Prediction**

Description: Built a regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and house age.

**Key Features:**

Cleaned and scaled input features using StandardScaler.

Implemented linear regression to predict house prices.

Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Demonstrated prediction on new data points.

**Sample Output:**

Predicted Prices: [498,000, 601,000]
Mean Squared Error: 2.3e+09
Predicted price for new house: $578,000


**Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn**

**2. Image Classification & OCR Text Extraction with Document Type Classification**

Description: Developed a pipeline to classify images and extract text from documents, then categorize documents into types (e.g., payslip, rental, invoice) using deep learning.

**Key Features:**

Extracted text from images using Tesseract OCR.

Built an LSTM-based neural network for text classification.

Preprocessed text with tokenization and sequence padding.

Trained and evaluated the model with multi-class classification.

Developed a classify_document() function for predicting document type.

**Sample Output:**

Extracted Text: Employee salary for February 2026: $1000
Document Type: payslip


**Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, LSTM, OCR, Pandas**

**Learning Journey & Goals**

Continuously improving skills in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP.

Experimenting with real-world datasets for predictive modeling and document automation.

Aiming to build AI systems that integrate vision and text understanding for practical applications.
